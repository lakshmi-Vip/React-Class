Question: What is throttling in JavaScript?

Answer: Throttling is a technique used to limit the number of times a function can be called over a period of time. 
It ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified interval, regardless of how many times the event is triggered.

Question: What is debouncing in JavaScript?

Answer: Debouncing is a technique used to ensure that a function is only called once after a specified period of time has passed since the last time it was invoked. 
It is useful for limiting the rate at which a function is executed, especially for events that may be triggered frequently, such as keystrokes or window resizing.

29. What is Redux, and components of Redux, core principles of Redux?
Question: What is Redux and what are its core principles?

Answer:

Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
Core Principles:
Single Source of Truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
State is Read-Only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
Changes are Made with Pure Functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
Components of Redux:

Store: Holds the state of the application.
Actions: Plain objects describing the type of change.
Reducers: Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return the next state.
30. Difference between Redux and Flux?
Question: What is the difference between Redux and Flux?

Answer:

Flux: An architecture for building client-side web applications. It has multiple stores and unidirectional data flow.
Redux: A library for managing application state. It has a single store and follows the same unidirectional data flow but with a more predictable state management approach.
